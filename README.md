## Synopsis

This game follows the [Myth of Zeus and Lycaon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaon_(king_of_Arcadia)) and must be played with two players, one on the mouse and one on the keyboard. In Greek Mythology, Lycaon cooked his own Son and fed him to Zeus to see if Zeus was smart enough to figure out it was human flesh. Zeus was furious towards Lycaon, in this game, Lycaon, the player controlled by the keyboard tries to run away from Zeus, controlled by the mouse that chases him from atop a cumulus of clouds and sends lightning strikes at him to strike him down.  

## Gameplay

### Lycaon
Lycaon's goal is to survive long enough to reach the end of the map and jump into a hole, granting him victory. 
The Lycaon view is on the right, he's entirely controlled by WASD and Left-CTRL. 

- W : Move Forward
- S : Move Backwards
- A : Rotate to the left
- D : Rotate to the right
- Left-CTRL : Dash forward in a cloud of smoke

### Zeus

The goal of Zeus is to kill Lycaon. 

Zeus is entirely controlled by the mouse. Left click allows him to shoot lightning at Lycaon. There is a cooldown to every strike, when the yellow bar in the top left of the screen is full then Zeus may strike. 

After a certain amount of strikes, Zeus can no longer strike until he's had his strength replenished by consuming nectar. Nectar is a golden nugget that appears on screen that Zeus must click on to be able to use his Lightning strike again. 

## Research

This game was developed for the sake of answering a research question in an academic setting. Our research question was Two-Fold: 

1) *Does Fittsâ€™s law work with an eye tracking modality?*
2) *Are instant point and click based games better adapted to eye tracking modalities than mouse ?*

To this end we measured two quantities to answer these questions : the avera
